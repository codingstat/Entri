Conclusion
In conclusion, this data analysis aimed to address the significant challenge of predicting house prices in Bangalore, a critical concern for both real estate stakeholders and potential homebuyers. Throughout the project, we embarked on a comprehensive journey from data preparation and exploration to modeling and analysis. Our investigation revealed several key insights. We identified location, square footage, and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms as the primary factors influencing house prices in Bangalore. However, it's important to acknowledge that this analysis has its limitations, including the availability and quality of data.

From the analysis, we found that

Cubbon Road has average high priced housings.
4 BHK is having highest price.
When square feet of the house increases, as per the location only the price is increasing. So we can say that the location of the house is a major factor which determines the price.
Moving forward, we recommend that real estate stakeholders consider these influential factors in their decision-making processes. Homebuyers, in particular, can benefit from this analysis by making more informed choices. In the future, expanding the analysis to incorporate additional variables, such as neighborhood amenities and transportation accessibility, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the property market in Bangalore. This project not only contributes to the field of property valuation but also has the potential to drive meaningful change in the real estate industry and enhance decision-making for all stakeholders involved.
